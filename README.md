# MultiAgentPathfinding
This is my project for the Artificial Intelligence 4 course as given at the University of Southern Denmark.

##Projects
This repository houses two projects
* MoveSimulation
* MultiAgentAStar

MoveSimulation is a project that depends on lpzrobots, where-as MultiAgentAStar only requires a C++11 compiler.
